# SymbolicMapleLatex
MapleTex is a very simple package intended to enable the user to programmatically include the results of Maple computations in Latex documents; the focus is on symbolic computations but numerics and figures can also be
used. Hence it is similar to the various “sweave” packages that exist for Matlab, SageMath, R, Python etc. But the emphasis of MapleTex is on simplicity
